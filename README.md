# Flight Delay Predictor

**Repository**: Machine Learning Project on Predicting Flight Delays

Flight delays and cancellations have been a persistent challenge in the aviation industry, causing widespread disruptions, financial losses, and reducing customer satisfaction. Understanding the factors that contribute to these delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and enhancing the travel experience.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the probability of flight delays or cancellations. By analyzing historical flight data, key variables such as airline performance, departure schedules, and airport traffic will be used to provide accurate and actionable predictions. The ultimate goal is to empower passengers to make informed travel decisions while helping airlines optimize their operations.

## Project Overview

The **Flight Delay Dataset (2018–2022)** provides a comprehensive repository of historical flight data, enabling an in-depth analysis of delay patterns and trends across the United States. The dataset includes a wide range of critical features such as:

- Airline performance
- Flight schedules
- Departure and arrival delays
- Airport congestion
- Seasonal variations

With over four years of detailed data, the project will explore these insights to develop a robust machine learning model. This model will help airlines identify potential bottlenecks and improve schedule reliability while enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Key Features of the Project:
- **Predictive Model**: Leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict flight delays and cancellations.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface that empowers passengers with flight delay predictions and helps airlines make data-driven decisions.
- **Operational Insights**: Use analytics to identify key factors contributing to delays and cancellations, providing actionable insights for airlines.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore seasonal variations, airport congestion, and other key variables to improve operational resilience and enhance the passenger experience.
